    <description brief="base types for robotic infrastructures">
        This software package are header-only definitions of types that are
        generally useful for robotic systems. It can be installed as either a
        pure header library (i.e. no build and/or binaries involved), or as an
        orogen project. In the latter case, the types can then be used in other
        orogen projects for the component interfaces.
